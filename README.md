# 3D Object Classification and Segmentation Using PointNet

This project focuses on the implementation of PointNet, a deep neural network that directly consumes point clouds, for the tasks of 3D object classification and segmentation. The model has been trained and tested on the ModelNet10 dataset, demonstrating its capability to efficiently process raw point clouds for various applications including autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.
